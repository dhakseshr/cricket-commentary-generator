# ==============================================================================
# !! CRITICAL !!
# D-ID's API requires a PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE URL for audio and image files.
# It cannot read local files from your computer.
#
# This function is a STUB. It does NOT upload your file.
#
# --- YOUR OPTIONS ---
# 1. (Recommended) Use a service like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage,
#    or Cloudinary to upload your file and get a temporary public URL.
# 2. (Dev/Testing) Use a tool like `ngrok` to expose your local
#    file server (or even just the `temp` dir) to the internet.
#    e.g., `ngrok http 8000`
#
# For this script, we will return a PLACEHOLDER and print a warning.
# You MUST replace this logic with a real upload implementation.
